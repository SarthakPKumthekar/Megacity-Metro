# Getting Started

## Important Note Before You Begin

The Megacity-Metro sample is large, so the **first time** cloning and playing the sample may take more time than expected. Subsequent plays should load much quicker because of caching.

First time clone and load time estimates:
- Cloning the Megacity-Metro repo: Up to 20 min
- Opening the project with library build: Up to 20 min
- Building the project for each platform for the first time: Up to 50 min. 
Navigate to `Project Settings > Other Settings > Configuration > C++ Compiler Configuration`and set `Debug` if you need to compile faster than optimal.

To get the Megacity-Metro sample, you can clone the project using Git. 
**Please note that direct download of the project is not currently supported for this repository**.

## Clone the Project

Before you can clone the project, you must install Git Large File Support (LFS). Megacity-Metro uses Git LFS to handle all large assets required locally. 
Refer to [Git LFS installation options](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation) for instructions on Windows and Mac. 

## Quick Start

After you clone the project, follow these steps to start playing:
1. Install a compatible Unity Editor version. During install make sure to include, Windows/Mac Build Support (IL2CPP), Windows/Mac Dedicated Server Build Support, Android/iOS Build Support (in case you want to build for phones) and Linux Dedicated Server Build Support.
2. To add the project to the **Unity Hub**, click the **Add** button and select the root folder of the cloned project.
3. Open the **Menu** scene located in `Assets/Scenes/Menu`. 
4. Click the **Play** button to start.
5. Start the Single Player mode. Multiplayer requires more setup which will be explained next.
